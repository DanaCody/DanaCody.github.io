I am a former physicist, future data scientist, but right now, I'm a data analyst. One of the reasons I really enjoy data science, is because how interdisciplinary it is. One of my favorite things to do is to ask questions, and with the power of data, I can answer these questions. 

I have a lot of ideas for projects, so stay tuned, I've got some good stuff coming. 

#### What else?

Beyond physics and data, I enjoy cooking, listing to music, being outside, and reading. 

#### Let's talk!

Shoot me an email if you are interested in what I am doing, if you want to talk data or about something completely unrelated. I'd love to chat. My email is [dana.cody.sn@gmail.com](mailto:dana.cody.sn@gmail.com).
